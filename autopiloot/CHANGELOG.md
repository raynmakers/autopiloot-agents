### Technical Specifications

#### Multi-Agent Communication
- **Agency Chart**: ScraperAgent (CEO) → TranscriberAgent → SummarizerAgent with ObservabilityAgent monitoring
- **Communication Flows**: Event-driven coordination through Firestore collections
- **Workflow Pipeline**: Video discovery → transcription → summarization with checkpoints

#### External Integrations
