### Technical Specifications

#### Multi-Agent Communication
- **Agency Chart**: OrchestratorAgent (CEO) coordinating Scraper → Transcriber → Summarizer with Observability monitoring
- **Communication Flows**: Event-driven coordination through Firestore collections
- **Workflow Pipeline**: Video discovery → transcription → summarization with checkpoints

#### External Integrations
- **YouTube Data API**: Video discovery with 10k units/day quota management
- **AssemblyAI**: Transcription with 70-minute duration limit and $5/day budget
- **OpenAI GPT-4.1**: Business-focused summarization with token tracking
- **Google Cloud**: Firestore, Drive, Sheets integration with service account authentication
- **Slack**: Rich notifications with Block Kit formatting and channel routing

#### Data Processing Pipeline
- **Status Progression**: discovered → transcription_queued → transcribed → summarized
- **Idempotency**: Video ID as natural key with deduplication across processing stages
- **Error Handling**: Exponential backoff (60s → 120s → 240s) with dead letter queue escalation
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging to audit_logs collection for compliance

#### Performance & Reliability
- **Checkpoint System**: lastPublishedAt persistence for incremental processing
