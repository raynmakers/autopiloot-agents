# 1) Objective

Enable runtime-adjustable weights and experiment tags to evaluate fusion.

# 2) Steps

1. Configurable weights/top_k/timeouts with overrides via flags.
2. Log parameters and outcomes; basic evaluator comparing fused vs single-source.
3. Observability dashboards for experiments.

# 3) Acceptance

- Weights can be toggled without redeploy; experiment metrics visible.
