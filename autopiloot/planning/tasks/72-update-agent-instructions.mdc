# 1) High-Level Objective

Revise instructions to include indexing (Zep + OpenSearch) and hybrid retrieval usage.

# 2) Low-Level Steps

1. In `summarizer_agent/instructions.md`:
   - After saving transcript, instruct to call both upsert-to-Zep and index-to-OpenSearch tools.
   - Document hybrid retrieval usage and when to apply filters.

2. In `orchestrator_agent/instructions.md`:
   - Add responsibility to trigger backfill jobs and hybrid retrieval for downstream consumers.
   - Emphasize Firestore as broker, but retrieval from Zep/OpenSearch.

# 3) Acceptance Criteria

- Instructions clearly describe Hybrid RAG steps and tool names.
