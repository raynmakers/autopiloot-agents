# 1) Objective

Achieve coverage targets and robust tests for tools and end-to-end flows.

# 2) Steps

1. Unit tests for tools (mock Zep/OpenSearch/BigQuery); ≥80% per tool; 100% init/config.
2. Integration: save transcript → Zep/OS/BQ fan-out; retrieval fusion; degraded modes.
3. Generate HTML coverage reports and include in repo.

# 3) Acceptance

- Coverage thresholds met; CI green; reports generated.
