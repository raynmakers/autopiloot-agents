# 1) High-Level Objective

Remove hard-coded channel strings and route all channel selection through `get_channel_for_alert_type`.

# 2) Steps

1. Sweep tools/services for hard-coded channels.
2. Replace with util call; ensure default channel picked from settings/env.

# 3) Acceptance Criteria

- All Slack sends use unified channel resolution.

# 4) Testing Strategy

- Update/send tests to assert channel normalization rules.
