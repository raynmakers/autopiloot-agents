# 1) Objective

Track embedding model versions; add CI tests for hybrid scenarios; monitor drift.

# 2) Steps

1. Persist `embedding_model_version` in metadata.
2. CI: hybrid retrieval tests to prevent regressions.
3. Drift: monitor token lengths, retrieval coverage trends.

# 3) Acceptance

- CI gates include hybrid tests; drift metrics available.
