# 1) Objective

Cache frequent query embeddings and OpenSearch results with TTL.

# 2) Steps

1. Add in-memory/redis-compatible cache interface.
2. Cache keys: normalized (query, filters, top_k).
3. Bypass cache on strict filters or small top_k if needed.

# 3) Acceptance

- Cache hit ratio reported; no stale data issues for time-bounded content.
