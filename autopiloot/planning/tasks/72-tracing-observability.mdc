# 1) Objective

Instrument retrieval pipeline: per-source latency, error rates, coverage, fusion weights.

# 2) Steps

1. Add trace IDs across Zep/OS/BQ calls; measure timings.
2. Collect metrics in `observability_agent`; Slack alerts on thresholds.
3. Daily digest: coverage %, slow-path stats, error summaries.

# 3) Acceptance

- Dashboards and alerts in place; traceable requests.
