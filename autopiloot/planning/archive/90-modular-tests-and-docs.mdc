# 1) High-Level Objective

Add tests for registry and flows; update docs/README and auto-generate Mermaid charts for new agents.

# 2) Background / Context

Ensures quality and developer experience.

# 3) Assumptions & Constraints

- Use unittest; no external services.

# 4) Dependencies

- tests/
- docs/

# 5) Context Plan

End state:

- tests for agent registry, flows validation, and CLI scaffold.
- docs/README updates on modular setup and configuration.

# 6) Low-Level Steps

1. Add tests for enabled_agents loading and flow validation.
2. Add CLI scaffold smoke test.
3. Update docs with configuration examples and workflow charts.

# 7) Acceptance Criteria

- Tests pass; docs reflect modular architecture.
