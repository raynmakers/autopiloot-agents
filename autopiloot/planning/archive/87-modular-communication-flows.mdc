# 1) High-Level Objective

Define `communication_flows` in `settings.yaml` and wire into `agency.py` construction.

# 2) Background / Context

Allows composing different agency topologies without code changes.

# 3) Assumptions & Constraints

- Validate agent names exist in loaded registry.

# 4) Dependencies

- agents/autopiloot/agency.py
- config/settings.yaml

# 5) Context Plan

End state:

- `agency.py` builds flows from config tuples.

# 6) Low-Level Steps

1. Add `communication_flows` to settings.yaml.
2. Parse and validate against loaded agents.

# 7) Acceptance Criteria

- Flows reflect config at runtime.
