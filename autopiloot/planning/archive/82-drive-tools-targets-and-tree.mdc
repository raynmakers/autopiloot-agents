# 1) High-Level Objective

Implement tools to load tracked targets and resolve folder trees recursively.

# 2) Background / Context

Feeds subsequent change listing and content ingestion.

# 3) Assumptions & Constraints

- Respect include/exclude patterns where provided.

# 4) Dependencies

- drive_agent/tools/

# 5) Context Plan

End state:

- drive_agent/tools/list_tracked_targets_from_config.py
- drive_agent/tools/resolve_folder_tree.py

# 6) Low-Level Steps

1. Implement config loader tool returning normalized targets.
2. Implement Drive traversal with pagination and error handling.

# 7) Acceptance Criteria

- JSON outputs; handles nested folders and pattern filters.
