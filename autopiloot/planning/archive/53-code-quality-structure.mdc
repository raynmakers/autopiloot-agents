# Objective

Avoid relative import pitfalls, centralize common helpers (slack channel normalization, ISO8601, backoff), and ensure agent folders are proper packages.

# Steps

1. Add `core/slack_utils.py` for channel normalization and shared helpers.
2. Move backoff/ISO8601 helpers to core utilities and reuse.
3. Ensure `__init__.py` exists for all agent/core folders; document `python -m` execution.

# Acceptance

- No attempted relative import errors; utilities reused across tools.
