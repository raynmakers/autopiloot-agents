# 1) High-Level Objective

Each agent exposes `get_schedules()` / `get_triggers()`; functions register them dynamically.

# 2) Background / Context

Lets agencies customize which jobs are active.

# 3) Assumptions & Constraints

- Keep backwards-compatible default schedules.

# 4) Dependencies

- services/firebase/functions/scheduler.py

# 5) Context Plan

End state:

- Helper reads enabled agents and registers schedules.

# 6) Low-Level Steps

1. Define optional hooks in agents returning cron specs and event handlers.
2. Modify scheduler to read hooks from enabled agents.

# 7) Acceptance Criteria

- Schedules reflect enabled agents and their hooks.
