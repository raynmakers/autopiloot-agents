# Objective

Introduce a CI workflow running unit tests; ensure external integrations are mocked by default; add linting/type checks optionally.

# Steps

1. Add `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` to run `python -m unittest discover -v` on push/PR.
2. Add lint (ruff/flake8) and type-check (mypy/pyright) stages (optional).
3. Stabilize tests to mock external APIs (Slack, Firestore, AssemblyAI, YouTube).

# Acceptance

- CI passes on clean repo; tests deterministic; docs updated in docs/testing.md.
