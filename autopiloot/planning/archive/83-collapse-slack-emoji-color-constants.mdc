title: "Unify Slack emoji/color constants"
status: "completed"
priority: "P3"
labels: ["refactor", "slack", "constants"]
dependencies: ["TASK-0072"]

# 1) High-Level Objective

Maintain emoji/color mappings in one place; remove copies in tools.

# 2) Steps

1. Move/ensure maps in `core/slack_utils`.
2. Update tools to read from util; delete in-file maps.

# 3) Acceptance Criteria

- Single mapping source; formatting unchanged.

# Completion Summary

**Completed:** 2025-10-16

**Status:** Already completed as part of TASK-0072

**Verification Results:**

This task was effectively completed during TASK-0072 implementation when all Slack formatting logic was consolidated into `core/slack_utils.py`. Comprehensive verification confirms:

1. **Single Source of Truth Established** (core/slack_utils.py lines 111-136):
   ```python
   # Lines 111-120: Color mappings
   color_mapping = {
       "critical": "#FF0000",  # Red
       "error": "#FF6B6B",     # Light red
       "warning": "#FFD93D",   # Yellow
       "info": "#6BCF7F",      # Green
       "dlq": "#FF8C00",       # Orange
       "budget": "#9B59B6",    # Purple
       "quota": "#E74C3C",     # Dark red
       "daily": "#3498DB"      # Blue
   }

   # Lines 125-134: Emoji mappings
   emoji_mapping = {
       "critical": "üö®",
       "error": "‚ùå",
       "warning": "‚ö†Ô∏è",
       "info": "‚ÑπÔ∏è",
       "dlq": "üîÑ",
       "budget": "üí∞",
       "quota": "üìä",
       "daily": "üìÖ"
   }
   ```

2. **No Duplicate Mappings Found:**
   - Grep search for `emoji_mapping = {`: Only found in core/slack_utils.py
   - Grep search for `color_mapping = {`: Only found in core/slack_utils.py
   - Grep search for all color hex codes: Only found in core/slack_utils.py
   - All tools delegate to centralized `format_alert_blocks()` function

3. **Tools Already Using Centralized Mappings:**
   - observability_agent/tools/format_slack_blocks.py: Delegates to core.slack_utils.format_alert_blocks()
   - observability_agent/tools/send_slack_message.py: Uses core.slack_utils.normalize_channel_name()
   - All other alert tools use centralized functions

4. **Functionality Unchanged:**
   - All 8 alert types still map to correct emojis and colors
   - Channel resolution works correctly
   - Message formatting produces identical output
   - No breaking changes to existing tools

**Consolidation Achieved:**
- ‚úÖ Emoji mappings: Single source in core/slack_utils.py
- ‚úÖ Color mappings: Single source in core/slack_utils.py
- ‚úÖ No duplicate definitions anywhere in codebase
- ‚úÖ All tools use centralized utilities
- ‚úÖ Formatting consistency maintained across all alerts

**Benefits:**
- **Eliminated code duplication**: No duplicate emoji/color definitions
- **Single point of maintenance**: Changes to mappings only need to happen once
- **Consistent visual identity**: All alerts use same emoji/color scheme
- **Easy customization**: Can modify all alert appearances by changing one file
- **Type safety**: Centralized mappings catch typos in alert types

**Note:** This task had zero remaining work since TASK-0072 already accomplished all consolidation objectives. The verification process confirmed complete consolidation with no duplicate mappings remaining in the codebase.
