# 1) High-Level Objective

Implement `mine_trigger_phrases`, `synthesize_strategy_playbook`, `generate_content_briefs`, `save_strategy_artifacts`.

# 2) Background / Context

Deliver actionable outputs and store them.

# 3) Assumptions & Constraints

- Use LLM with task-specific settings; Drive/Firestore/Zep for storage.

# 4) Dependencies

- strategy_agent/tools/

# 5) Context Plan

End state:

- strategy_agent/tools/mine_trigger_phrases.py
- strategy_agent/tools/synthesize_strategy_playbook.py
- strategy_agent/tools/generate_content_briefs.py
- strategy_agent/tools/save_strategy_artifacts.py

# 6) Low-Level Steps

1. Implement trigger phrase mining (log-odds method) with cohorts.
2. Implement playbook synthesis (MD + JSON) with prompt/version tracking.
3. Implement briefs generation; ensure diversity.
4. Implement storage to Drive/Firestore and optional Zep doc.

# 7) Acceptance Criteria

- Outputs saved; references persisted; tests cover core paths.
