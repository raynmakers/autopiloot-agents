# 1) High-Level Objective

Prevent regressions by failing CI when any tool filename is not snake_case.

# 2) Background / Context

Mixed naming causes import issues; we standardized, now enforce.

# 3) Assumptions & Constraints

- CI workflow exists or will be extended later.

# 4) Dependencies

- agents/autopiloot/scripts/

# 5) Context Plan

Beginning:

- N/A

End state:

- `agents/autopiloot/scripts/check_tool_filenames_snake_case.sh`
- CI calls the script before tests

# 6) Low-Level Steps

1. Add shell script to scan `agents/autopiloot/**/tools/*.py` and assert `^[a-z0-9_]+\.py$`.
2. Update CI workflow to run the script.
3. Optional: add pre-commit hook.

# 7) Acceptance Criteria

- CI fails on non-compliant filenames with clear output
