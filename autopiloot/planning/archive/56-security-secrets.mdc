# Objective

Ensure no secrets in code; document `.env`/service account setup and Firestore Admin SDK usage.

# Steps

1. Audit repo for secrets; confirm `.env` in .gitignore; add pre-commit hook suggestion.
2. Expand docs/environment.md with service account creation steps and minimal scopes.
3. Clarify Firestore Admin SDK usage and rules expectations in FIREBASE_IMPLEMENTATION.md.

# Acceptance

- No secrets present; clear setup docs; guidance for rotation and scopes.
