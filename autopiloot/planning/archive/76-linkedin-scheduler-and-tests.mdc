# 1) High-Level Objective

Schedule daily LinkedIn ingestion and add tests for tools and flow.

# 2) Background / Context

Daily check for new posts; backfill runs capped.

# 3) Assumptions & Constraints

- Use Firebase Functions scheduler at 06:00 Europe/Amsterdam (configurable).

# 4) Dependencies

- services/firebase/functions/scheduler.py
- tests/

# 5) Context Plan

End state:

- Scheduled function calling LinkedIn Agent workflow.
- tests/linkedin_tools/\* with unit tests for each tool.

# 6) Low-Level Steps

1. Add scheduled function; lazy-init LinkedIn Agent.
2. Create test files per tool; mock RapidAPI and Zep/Firestore.

# 7) Acceptance Criteria

- Scheduler runs; tests pass locally.
