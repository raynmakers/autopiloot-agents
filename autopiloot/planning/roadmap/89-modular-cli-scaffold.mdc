# 1) High-Level Objective

Create `scripts/new_agent.py` to scaffold agents with structure, instructions, tools folder, tests, and chart.

# 2) Background / Context

Speeds duplication and reuse.

# 3) Assumptions & Constraints

- Pure Python script; no external deps.

# 4) Dependencies

- agents/autopiloot/

# 5) Context Plan

End state:

- scripts/new_agent.py
- template assets under scripts/templates/

# 6) Low-Level Steps

1. Implement CLI args: name, description, tools list.
2. Render files with snake_case and package paths.

# 7) Acceptance Criteria

- Running script produces a ready-to-wire agent package.
