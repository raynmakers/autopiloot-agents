# INSTRUCTIONS — READ THIS FIRST WHEN CREATING NEW TASKS

This file is a single, self-contained TASK for an AI agent. **One task = one file.**
Follow the steps below when creating new tasks.

1. **Name your file**: place under `./tasks/` and use kebab-case, e.g., `tasks/add-bar-chart.md`.
2. **Fill the frontmatter** (above) completely. Keep `title`, `status`, and `owner` accurate.
3. **Use information-dense keywords** throughout (exact file paths, function signatures, type names, constants, CLI flags).
4. **Define types first** if adding new data structures. Reference those types by exact name in later steps.
5. **Order your steps** so later steps explicitly reference earlier artifacts by name (files, types, functions).
6. **Keep scope tight**: this task should be completable independently. If it’s large, split into multiple task files and add them to `dependencies`.
7. **Acceptance criteria** must be testable and unambiguous. Include file paths for tests and example CLI/API usage.
8. **Context plan** must list the files to add to the model’s context at the start (mark dep files read-only) and which files must exist at the end.
9. **Testing strategy** use primarily integration tests, calling real APIs. No useless unit tests that just test the properties of the class. No tests for front end.

id: "<unique-id-or-ticket>" # e.g., TASK-0123
title: "<short, action-oriented task title>" # e.g., "Add quartile-colored bar chart"
status: "planned" # planned, in-progress, blocked, done
priority: "P1" # P0, P1, P2
labels: ["feature", "cli", "charts"] # free-form tags
dependencies: ["<other-task-file>"] # list other task files that must be completed first

# 1) High-Level Objective

<One sentence that describes the user-facing end state. Avoid technical jargon.>

# 2) Background / Context (Optional but recommended)

<Short rationale or business context for why this task exists. Link any tickets/PRDs.>

# 3) Assumptions & Constraints

- ASSUMPTION: <If any info is missing, state the pragmatic assumption here.>
- Constraint: <e.g., “Use only deps listed in package.json/pyproject.toml”.>
- Constraint: <e.g., “Prefer TypeScript for app, Python for scripts”.>

# 4) Dependencies (Other Tasks or Artifacts)

- tasks/<other-task-file>.md
- files/<required-existing-file-or-schema>

# 5) Context Plan

**Beginning (add to model context):**

- src/main.ts
- src/types.ts
- package.json _(read-only)_
- pyproject.toml _(read-only)_

**End state (must exist after completion):**

- src/charts/bar.ts
- src/charts/index.ts
- tests/charts/bar.test.ts

# 6) Low-Level Steps (Ordered, information-dense)

> Write concrete, atomic steps. Include **file paths, exact names, signatures, params with defaults, return types**.

1. **Create bar chart module**

   - File: `src/charts/bar.ts`
   - Exported API:
     ```ts
     export type WordCounts = Record<string, number>; // or import from src/types.ts
     export function renderQuartileBarChart(
       counts: WordCounts,
       options?: { minCount?: number; outputPath?: string }
     ): Promise<void>;
     ```
   - Details:
     - Filter out entries with `count < options.minCount ?? 10`
     - Sort desc, keep top 100
     - Color top quartile green, bottom red, remaining blue
     - Write PNG to `options.outputPath ?? "charts/word_freq_bar.png"`

2. **Re-export in index**

   - File: `src/charts/index.ts`
   - Add: `export * from "./bar";`

3. **CLI wire-up**

   - File: `src/main.ts`
   - Add flag `--chart-type bar`, and when selected, call:
     ```ts
     await renderQuartileBarChart(result.counts, {
       minCount: flags.minCount,
       outputPath: flags.output,
     });
     ```
   - Update help text accordingly.

4. **Tests**
   - File: `tests/charts/bar.test.ts` (Jest)
   - Cases:
     - Renders without error with mixed frequencies
     - Respects `minCount` filter
     - Produces output file path when provided

# 7) Types & Interfaces (if applicable)

> Define or reference types here so the model has a stable contract.

```ts
// src/types.ts
export interface TranscriptAnalysis {
  summary: string;
  keywords: string[];
}
export type WordCounts = Record<string, number>;
```

# 8) Acceptance Criteria

- `src/charts/bar.ts` exports `renderQuartileBarChart(...)` with the exact signature above.
- Running `uv run main --chart-type bar --output charts/out.png` writes a PNG file.
- All tests in `tests/charts/bar.test.ts` pass locally.

# 9) Testing Strategy

- Create an integration test that draws a quartile bar chart and writes it to a file.
- Run the test and ensure the file exists.
- Integrate into the existing end-to-end tests.
